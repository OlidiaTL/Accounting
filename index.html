        </div>

        <h3>Income</h3>
        <p>Income is the money that a business or individual earns. This can come from various sources, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sales Revenue:</strong> Money received from selling goods or services.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest Income:</strong> Money earned from savings accounts or investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Rent:</strong> Money received from leasing property.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Expense</h3>
        <p>Expense is the money that a business or individual spends. This includes costs incurred to operate or maintain activities, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rent:</strong> Money paid for using a space (like an office).</li>
            <li><strong>Salaries:</strong> Money paid to employees for their work.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Payments for services like electricity, water, and internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>In simple terms, income is what you earn, and expenses are what you spend.</em></p>

        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>An account is opened for each type of expense and income.</strong><br>

        <h3>Balancing Ledger Accounts</h3>
        <p>Balancing a ledger account is an essential task in bookkeeping to ensure that the debits and credits are equal. Here are the steps to balance a ledger account:</p>

        <h4>Instructions to Balance a Ledger Account</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Your Ledger</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gather all transactions related to the account you want to balance.</li>
                    <li>Ensure you have the opening balance for the period.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Record Transactions</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>List all debits (money coming in) and credits (money going out) in the ledger account.</li>
                    <li>Each transaction should have a date, description, and amount.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calculate Total Debits</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add up all the debit entries.</li>
                    <li>Write the total at the bottom of the debit side.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calculate Total Credits</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add up all the credit entries.</li>
                    <li>Write the total at the bottom of the credit side.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Page 7: Balancing Instructions Continued -->
    <div class="page page-break">
        <ol start="5">
            <li><strong>Determine the Difference</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subtract the total credits from the total debits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If total debits > total credits, you have a debit balance.</li>
                            <li>If total credits > total debits, you have a credit balance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enter the Balance</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write the difference as a balance on the side that is lower (debit or credit) to equalize the two sides.</li>
                    <li>Label this entry as "Balance c/d" (carried down) with the date.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Close the Account</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>At the end of the period, carry the balance forward to the next period.</li>
                    <li>Write this as "Balance b/d" (brought down) in the new period's ledger.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Review for Accuracy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Double-check all calculations and entries for accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the total debits equal total credits after entering the balance.</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>DOUBLE-ENTRY RECORDS FOR SALES, PURCHASES, AND RETURNS</h3>

        <h4>1. Double Entry Accounting Principle</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Every transaction affects at least two accounts.</li>
            <li>Debits must equal credits, maintaining the accounting equation:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Sales Transactions</h4>
        <strong>Sales of Goods: For Cash or Cheque</strong> – money is received immediately as the goods are sold in the form of cash or a cheque
        <ul>
            <li>Debit: Cash or Bank Account (increase in assets)</li>
            <li>Credit: Sales Revenue (increase in income)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <strong>Example Entry:</strong><br>
            If goods are sold for cash $100:
            <ul>
                <li>Debit Cash Account $100</li>
                <li>Credit Sales Revenue Account: $100</li>
            </ul>
            If goods are sold, a cheque of $300 is received:
